		<h2>Welcome to the Official Unofficial Snail Leaderboard</h2>
		<h4>Unordered and jumps around for no known reason. Use at your own risk.</h4>
		Only players above 10k snails are included. Entries are entered manually and don't dynamically update, so there can be more players above 10k snails. This is at best a bird's eye view of the game.<br>
